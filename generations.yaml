    description: "The original Jeep Commander was a full-size SUV built on a modified Grand Cherokee platform, notable as Jeep's first vehicle with standard three-row seating. Featuring squared-off, boxy styling inspired by the classic Cherokee and Wagoneer models, it presented a rugged, traditional SUV appearance despite sharing many components with the more rounded contemporary Grand Cherokee. The distinctive design included an upright windshield, squared-off sides, and an unusually tall roof to accommodate the stadium-style third-row seating. Powertrain options included a 3.7L V6, 4.7L V8, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 with Multi-Displacement System, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and various four-wheel drive systems including Quadra-Trac I, Quadra-Trac II, and Quadra-Drive II. The interior featured three rows of seating for up to seven passengers, though the third row was criticized for limited space and accessibility. Upscale features on higher trims included leather seating, premium audio systems, and dual-zone climate control. Despite its traditional Jeep off-road capability, the Commander struggled in the marketplace due to its introduction coinciding with rising fuel prices and shifting consumer preferences toward more efficient crossovers. Production ended after just four model years without a direct replacement as Chrysler restructured following its bankruptcy and acquisition by Fiat."

    description: "The Jeep Commander/Grand Commander sold in China was unrelated to the North American model, instead based on an extended version of the Cherokee platform. Developed specifically for the Chinese market where three-row SUVs are highly desirable, it featured more conventional crossover styling aligned with Jeep's contemporary design language. Offered in standard Commander (five-seat) and longer Grand Commander (seven-seat) variants, it was significantly smaller than the previous North American Commander. Powertrain options centered around a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder in various output levels, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The interior emphasized luxury and technology, featuring a modern design with a large touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster options, and premium materials. This China-specific model represented Jeep's effort to expand in the crucial Chinese market by developing regionally-specific products, though it was eventually discontinued as the joint venture between Stellantis and GAC struggled in an increasingly competitive Chinese automotive landscape."

    description: "The current Commander sold in South America (particularly Brazil) is a completely different vehicle from both previous Commander models, based on the Compass platform but extended to accommodate three rows of seating. Designed specifically for Latin American markets, it features styling consistent with Jeep's modern design language, including slim LED headlights, the seven-slot grille, and a floating roof effect created by blacked-out pillars. Powertrain options include a 1.3L turbocharged gasoline engine and a 2.0L turbodiesel, paired with either a six-speed or nine-speed automatic transmission depending on the variant. Front-wheel drive is standard with four-wheel drive available on higher trims. The interior emphasizes premium features and technology, including a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, and advanced driver assistance systems. Manufactured in Brazil, this Commander/Commander PHEV (plug-in hybrid variant added later) represents Jeep's strategy of developing market-specific products for regions like South America, where three-row SUVs at this size and price point have strong appeal. Despite sharing the Commander name, this model bears no direct relationship to either the original North American XK Commander or the Chinese K8 Commander."
